        <g class="under">Online Scams</g><br>Fraud is a lot easier in the age of the internet.
        Today, online scams are run from actual offices all around the world, with real people
        sending out hundreds of thousands of mails everday and setting up annoying pop-ups to
        convince you that your computer has a virus and should be checked on by a professional.<br>
        <br>Here are some quick tips for better safety on the internet:<br>
        * Think twice before clicking on links.<br>
        * Verify the authenticity of the business or person you are talking to.<br>
        * Beware of people trying to catfish you. Worst case, you get abducted by human traffickers.<br>
        * Watch out for grammatical errors in mails or websites. If you receive messages laden with errors about a “great deal” or contest, it’s probably a scam, even if it comes from a “friend.”
        On the other hand, scammers are getting smarter and use flawless wording to make their scams seem more legitimate.<br>
        * Weird offers. Nobody has free money to give away.<br>
        * Be cautious with giving away your personal information. <br>
